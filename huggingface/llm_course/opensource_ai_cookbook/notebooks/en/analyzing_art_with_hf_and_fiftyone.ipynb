We've seen how to perform image similarity and semantic searches, cluster images based on their style, analyze the uniqueness of images, and compute image quality metrics. These techniques can be applied to a wide range of visual datasets, from art collections to medical images to satellite imagery. Try [loading a different dataset from the Hugging Face Hub](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/huggingface.html#loading-datasets-from-the-hub) and see what insights you can uncover!\n",
