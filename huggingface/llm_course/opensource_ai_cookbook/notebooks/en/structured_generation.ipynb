    "# RAG with source highlighting using Structured generation\n",
    "_Authored by: [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric)_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured generation** is a method that forces the LLM output to follow certain constraints, for instance to follow a specific pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has numerous use cases:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Output a dictionary with specific keys\n",
    "- üìè Make sure the output will be longer than N characters\n",
    "- ‚öôÔ∏è More generally, force the output to follow a certain regex pattern for downtream processing.\n",
    "- üí° Highlight sources supporting the answer in Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate specifically the last use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚û°Ô∏è We build a RAG system that not only provides an answer, but also highlights the supporting snippets that this answer is based on.**\n",
    "\n",
    "_If you need an introduction to RAG, you can check out [this other cookbook](advanced_rag)._\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook first shows a naive approach to structured generation via prompting and highlights its limits, then demonstrates constrained decoding for more efficient structured generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It leverages HuggingFace Inference Endpoints (the example shows a [serverless](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour) endpoint, but you can directly change the endpoint to a [dedicated](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/en/guides/access) one), then also shows a local pipeline using [outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines), a structured text generation library."
