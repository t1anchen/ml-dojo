    "# Semantic reranking with Elasticsearch and Hugging Face\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn how to implement semantic reranking in Elasticsearch by uploading a model from Hugging Face into an Elasticsearch cluster. We'll use the `retriever` abstraction, a simpler Elasticsearch syntax for crafting queries and combining different search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a cross-encoder model from Hugging Face to perform semantic reranking\n",
    "- Upload the model to your Elasticsearch deployment using [Eland](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/eland/current/machine-learning.html)‚Äî a Python client for machine learning with Elasticsearch \n",
    "- Create an inference endpoint to manage your `rerank` task\n",
    "- Query your data using the `text_similarity_rerank` retriever"
