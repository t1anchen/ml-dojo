Don't feel compelled to use Jupyter.

    "- `--model-id`\n",
    "- `--quantize` Quantization saves memory, but does not always improve speed\n",
    "- `--max-input-tokens` This allows TGI to optimize the prefilling operation\n",
    "- `--max-total-tokens` In combination with the above TGI now knows what the max input and output tokens are\n",
    "- `--max-batch-size` This lets TGI know how many requests it can process at once.\n",
