\ansno2.1: Alice said, ``I always use an en-dash instead of a hyphen
when specifying page numbers like `480--491' in a bibliography.''


\ansno2.2: Four hyphens `|----|' becomes one em-dash and one hyphen
`----'

\ansno2.4: ``\thinspace` and `\thinspace``


\ansno2.5: Following Occam's Razor Principle, introducing extra
complexity on typewriting annotations might not be a wise move because
it increases extra maintenance cost in minds and memory. Besides,
introducing dollar sign might cause confusions between {\sl Math mode}
and {\sl Text mode} that it may deteriorate maintenability of code.

note: \TeX\ ignores spaces after control worlds

summary: apprimately 300 of 900 control sequence in \TeX\ are {\sl
primitive}

\vskip.5\baselineskip\hrule\vskip.5\baselineskip

\ansno3.3: |\|\] is primitive, while |\|\<return> is represented as |^^M|

\ansno3.4:
([2025-05-09T00:11:26+08:00] after asking Perplexity.AI about how to
understand Knuth's answer, it makes sense now)

For length~2 case, the first position is always occupied by `|\|', the
remaining position is for a single ASCII character, which is 256
different variants (in the problem description, it said `including
escape character').

For length~3, it might be strictly limited to alphabet characters
(i.e. |[A-Za-z]| if represented in Regex). The first position is
contantly as `|\|', and each of the remaining positions has 52
variants, which is $52^2$ possible control sequences.

\ansno4.4:
The numeric ones would be possibly interpreted as `|\1|' and `0point'
instead of the entire control sequence.

\ansno4.5:
Quoted from official answer: ``Say |\def\sl{\it}| at the beginning,
and delete other definitions of\/ |\sl| that might be present in your
format file (e.g., there might be one inside a |\tenpoint| macro).''
