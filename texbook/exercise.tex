\ansno2.5: Following Occam's Razor Principle, introducing extra
complexity on typewriting annotations might not be a wise move because
it increases extra maintenance cost in minds and memory. Besides,
introducing dollar sign might cause confusions between {\sl Math mode}
and {\sl Text mode} that it may deteriorate maintenability of code.

For length~2 case, the first position is always occupied by `|\|', the
remaining position is for a single ASCII character, which is 256
different variants (in the problem description, it said `including
escape character').

For length~3, it might be strictly limited to alphabet characters
(i.e. |[A-Za-z]| if represented in Regex). The first position is
contantly as `|\|', and each of the remaining positions has 52
variants, which is $52^2$ possible control sequences.

\item\bull `|\c|' (cedilla)
\item\bull `|~|' (ties, treat as normal space but not
to break between lines, e.g. names)

\vskip.5\baselineskip\hrule\vskip.5\baselineskip

\ansno6.1:
Official answer: ``Laziness and/or obstinacy''

\ansno6.2:
Official answer: `` There's an unwanted space after `called---',
because (as the book says) \TeX\ treats the end of a line as if it
were a blank space. That blank space is usually what you want, except
when a line ends with a hyphen or a dash; so you should WATCH OUT for
lines that end with hyphens or dashes''

\ansno6.3:
Official answer: ``It represents the heavy bar that shows up in your
output. \ (This bar wouldn't be present if had been set to |0pt|, nor
is it present in an underfull box.)''

\ansno6.4:
Official answer: ``This is the |\parfillskip| space that ends the
paragraph.  In plain \TeX\ the parfillskip is zero when the last line
of the paragraph is full; hence no space actually appears before the
rule in the output of Experiment~3. But all hskips show up as spaces
in an overfull box message, even if they're zero.''

\ansno6.5:
Official answer: ``Run \TeX\ with \hbox{|\hsize=1.5in|} \hbox{|\tolerance=10000|}
\hbox{|\raggedright|} \hbox{|\hbadness=-1|} and then |\input story|. \TeX\ will
report the badness of all lines (except the final lines of paragraphs,
where fill glue makes the badness zero).''

\ansno6.6:
Official answer: ``|\def\extraspace{\nobreak \hskip 0pt plus
.15em\relax}|\parbreak
|\def\dash{\unskip\extraspace---\extraspace}|\par\nobreak\smallskip\noindent
(If you try this with the story at 2-inch and 1.5-inch sizes, you will
notice a substantial improvement. The |\unskip| allows people to leave
a space before typing |\dash|.  \TeX\ will try to hyphenate before
|\dash|, but not before `|---|'; cf.\ Appendix~H\null. The ^|\relax|
at the end of |\extraspace| is a precaution in case the next word is
`|minus|'.)''

\ansno6.7:
Official answer: ``\TeX\ would have deleted five tokens: |1|, |i|,
|n|, \], |\centerline|.  (The space was at the end of line~2, the
|\centerline| at the beginning of line~3.)''

\ansno6.8:
Official answer: ``A control sequence like |\centerline| might well
define a control sequence like |\ERROR| before telling \TeX\ to look
at |#1|. Therefore
\TeX\ doesn't interpret control sequences when it scans an argument.''

\ansno7.2:

felt best not to reserve |\\| for such limited use. Typists can define
|\\| to be whatever they want (including |\backslash|).''

Official answer: ``1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13. {Active
characters} (type 13) are somewhat special; they behave like control
sequences in most cases (e.g., when you say `|\let||\x=~|' or
`|\ifx||\x~|'), but they behave like character tokens when they appear
in the token list of\/ |\uppercase| or |\lowercase|, and when
unexpanded after |\if| or |\ifcat|.''

\ansno7.4:
Official answer: ``It ends with either |>| or |}| or any character of
category 2; then the effects of all |\catcode| definitions within the
group are wiped out, except those that were |\global|.''

\ansno7.5:
Official answer: ``If you type `|\message{\string~}|' and `|\message{\string\~}|', \TeX\
responds with `|~|' and `|\~|', respectively. ^^|\message|
To get |\|$_{12}$ from |\string| you therefore need to make backslash an
active character. One way to do this is
\begintt
{\catcode`/=0 \catcode`\\=13 /message{/string\}}
\endtt
(The ``^{null control sequence}'' that you get when there are no
tokens between |\csname| and |\endcsname| is not a solution to this exercise,
because |\string| converts it to `|\csname\endcsname|'. There is, however,
another solution: If \TeX's |\escapechar| parameter---which will be
explained in one of the next dangerous bends---is negative or greater
than~255, then `|\string\\|' works.)''

\ansno7.6:
|\|$_{12}$ |a|$_{12}$ |\|$_{12}$ \]$_{10}$ |b|$_{12}$.

\ansno7.7:
Official answer: ``|\def\ifundefined#1{\expandafter\ifx\csname#1\endcsname\relax}|%
\hfil\break Note that a control sequence like this must be used with care;
it cannot be included in {conditional} text, because the |\ifx| will not
be seen when |\ifundefined| isn't expanded.''

\ansno8.1:

|%| in \TeX can be interpreted as reserved keyword of comment
|%| character.

Official answer: ``The |%| would be treated as a comment character,
because its category code is~14; thus, no |%| token or |}| token would
get through to the gullet of \TeX\ where numbers are treated. When a
character is of category 0, 5, 9, 14, or~15, the extra |\| must be
used; and the |\| doesn't hurt, so you can always use it to be safe.''
